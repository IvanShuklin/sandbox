// Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
/*
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outermost (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

const subarray = arr[3];
const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0];
const element = arr[3][0][1];
In this example, subarray has the value [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], nestedSubarray has the value [10, 11, 12], and element has the value 11 .

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.
*/
const myArray = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
	[[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
]

const myData = myArray[2][1]

// Manipulate Arrays With push Method
/*
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() method.

The push() method takes one or more arguments and appends them to the end of the array, in the order in which they appear. It returns the new length of the array.

Examples:

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4, 5);

const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
arr1 now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and arr2 has the value ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]].

Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.

const newArray = [
	['John', 23],
	['cat', 2],
]

newArray.push(['dog', 3])
